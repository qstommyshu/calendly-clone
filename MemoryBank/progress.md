## Current Complexity Assessment
**Level 3 - Intermediate Feature** ‚úÖ Successfully Implemented

### Criteria Met Throughout Development:
- ‚úÖ Multiple components affected (5 files modified/created)
- ‚úÖ Database schema modifications implemented successfully
- ‚úÖ New routing and URL patterns working
- ‚úÖ UI integration across multiple pages implemented
- ‚úÖ All required creative design decisions implemented

### Creative Phases Successfully Implemented:
1. üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Design** ‚úÖ - ScheduleTable extension approach worked perfectly
2. üé® **UI/UX Design** ‚úÖ - Integrated schedule form design provides excellent UX
3. ‚öôÔ∏è **Algorithm Design** ‚úÖ - Route-based resolution provides clean separation

## Implementation Results Summary
### Database Implementation:
- **Approach**: Extended ScheduleTable with 3 new fields
- **Migration**: Successfully generated and applied
- **Performance**: Single table queries maintained (no joins required)
- **Validation**: Comprehensive Zod schema with proper constraints

### UI/UX Implementation:
- **Integration**: Seamless card section in ScheduleForm
- **Copy Access**: Available in both schedule form and events page
- **User Experience**: Intuitive configuration ‚Üí copy ‚Üí share workflow
- **Design Consistency**: Matches existing shadcn/ui patterns perfectly

### Routing Implementation:
- **URL Pattern**: Clean `/book/[userId]/primary` structure
- **Virtual Events**: Successfully creates event objects from schedule config
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive fallbacks for disabled/missing primary events
- **Component Reuse**: Leverages existing CalendarBookingForm without modification
