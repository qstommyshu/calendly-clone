# Tasks - Source of Truth

## Current Task
Primary Event Feature Implementation

### Phase 5: Integration & Testing ‚úÖ READY FOR TESTING
- [x] Development server running
- [ ] Test primary event configuration flow
- [ ] Test primary event booking flow
- [ ] Test copy functionality
- [ ] Verify URL routing works correctly
- [ ] Test edge cases and error scenarios

## Creative Phases Required

### Step 3: Copy Button Enhancement ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- [x] UI specification complete for copy functionality
- [x] Create CopyPrimaryEventButton component
- [x] Add primary event copy functionality to events page
- [x] Position copy button in UI (events page header)
- [x] Add primary event URL generation logic

### Step 4: Primary Booking Route ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- [x] Architecture complete: Route-based primary event resolution
- [x] Create new route `/book/[clerkUserId]/primary/page.tsx`
- [x] Implement primary event data fetching
- [x] Connect to existing booking form components
- [x] Handle cases where primary event is not configured
- [x] Add appropriate error handling and fallbacks

### Step 5: Integration & Testing ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS
- [x] Development server started
- [ ] Test primary event configuration flow
- [ ] Test primary event booking flow
- [ ] Test copy functionality
- [ ] Verify URL routing works correctly
- [ ] Test edge cases and error scenarios

## Design Decisions Made

### Database Architecture:
**Decision:** Extend ScheduleTable with primary event fields
- `primaryEventDuration INTEGER DEFAULT 30`
- `primaryEventDescription TEXT`  
- `primaryEventEnabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT true`

### UI/UX Design:
**Decision:** Integrated primary event section in schedule form
- Primary event configuration as card section in ScheduleForm
- Copy button in events page header
- URL preview with copy functionality in schedule form

### URL Routing:
**Decision:** Dedicated route-based resolution
- New route: `app/(public)/book/[clerkUserId]/primary/page.tsx`
- Virtual event object creation for existing booking components
- Clean separation from regular event booking logic

## Implementation Files Created/Modified

### Database & Schema:
- ‚úÖ `src/drizzle/schema.ts` - Added primary event fields to ScheduleTable
- ‚úÖ `src/drizzle/migrations/0001_far_swordsman.sql` - Migration generated and applied
- ‚úÖ `src/schema/schedule.ts` - Updated scheduleFormSchema with primary event validation

### Components:
- ‚úÖ `src/components/forms/ScheduleForm.tsx` - Added primary event configuration UI
- ‚úÖ `src/components/CopyPrimaryEventButton.tsx` - New component for primary URL copying

### Pages & Routes:
- ‚úÖ `src/app/(private)/schedule/page.tsx` - Pass userId to ScheduleForm
- ‚úÖ `src/app/(private)/events/page.tsx` - Added CopyPrimaryEventButton to header
- ‚úÖ `src/app/(public)/book/[clerkUserId]/primary/page.tsx` - New primary booking route
